May - June 2024
- Researched into different airplane models
- Determined which parts I needed (Created a BOM)
- Started on the CAD model of the plane (found electrical components, mechanical parts)
- Learned Flight controls and dynamics (still unsure about how certain things work)
- Finalized on a budget and the scope of the project
- Ordered all parts (Servos, RC Transmitter Controller, Battery, Motors, GPS, MPU)
- Final design pending; plan is to start the design process once all parts are in and the 
  firmware is almost complete
- Ultimate Goal: Create an autonomous RC plane
 - Vision: Pilot can switch modes from manual control to auto. In manual control, all RC inputs
   go directly into the Servos. No processing of sensors in this mode. In auto, user can simply give
   hardcoded longitude and langitude values to direct the plane. Note, DIRECT the plane, it will be hard
   to get the plane to go somewhere and stay there since this is a plane, not a quadcopter. So features like
   self-balancing is out of scope.
   - Sub-goals at the moment (interfacing stage):
    - Start learning RTOS and see how to control one servo using a simple task.
    - Try to see if I can achieve manual control first (see if I can control one Servo with a RC directly; no MCU)
    - Read data from the receiver, see if I can output data.
    - Redirect all channel inputs to the controls of the servo. See if I can control one servo with a RC
      where the MCU acts as the middle man.
    - Connect multiple servos (rudder, aileron, elevator), register them as seperate task and run them in parallel.
      - Determine RTOS design structure (how to handle all tasks)
      - Major firmware restructure will take place when I get here.
