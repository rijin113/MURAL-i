Servo Control:
- controlled using a pwm signal (has a defined period, duty cycle and frequency)
- in this case, it is being defined with a timebase period and timebase resolution.
- MCPWM Library has four main components for setting up PWM signal generation and timers.
    - Timer: Provides the base timing events (counting up to a period).
    - Operator: Coordinates the actions of comparators and generators within the same group, managing their interactions based on the timer's events.
    - Comparator: Sets the specific points within the timer period where actions should occur (e.g., when to set the GPIO pin low) (how long should the
      signal stay HIGH for within the overall time period given.)
    - Generator: Produces the PWM signal by setting the GPIO pin high or low according to the timer and comparator events managed by the operator.
